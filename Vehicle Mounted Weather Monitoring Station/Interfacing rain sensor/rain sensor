Step 2: INterfacing Rain Sensor


Hardware Required:
>Rain Sensor Module
>Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
>Jumper wires


Connections:
>VCC to 5V
>GND to GND
>Analog Output (A0) to an Analog pin (A0) on Arduino


Working Principle:
The Rain Sensor consists of a sensor board and a detection module. 
It detects the presence of water droplets by measuring the resistance change when water bridges the gap between the sensors conductive traces.
