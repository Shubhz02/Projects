Step 3: 

interfacing BMP180 (Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude Sensor)

Hardware Required:
> BMP180 Sensor Module
> Arduino (e.g., Uno)
> Jumper Wires
>>>>>> Used I2C communication protocol 
{
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial bus interface connection protocol. It is also called a TWI (two wire interface)
}



Connections:
The BMP180 uses the I2C communication protocol, so it connects to the Arduino’s SDA (A4) and SCL (A5) pins:

BMP180 Pin	Arduino Uno Pin
VCC	3.3V (or 5V)
GND	GND
SDA	A4
SCL	A5


>>>Install the BMP180 Library

install the Adafruit BMP180 Library:

Open Arduino IDE
Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
Search for Adafruit BMP085 Unified and install it (BMP180 uses this library).
