Step 6: 
Interfacing ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module (Wireless Data Transmission to Blynk App)

>>>The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module will connect to the internet and send real-time sensor data to the Blynk App, where you can monitor everything remotely.

Hardware Required:
>ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
>Arduino Uno
>Jumper Wires


Connection :
ESP-01 Pin	Arduino Pin
VCC	3.3V
GND	GND
TX	RX (via voltage divider)
RX	TX (direct if using level shifter)

 Using NodeMCU:
can you  connect it directly to the PC via USB (simpler option).

>>>>>>>Installing the Blynk Library

Open Arduino IDE.
>Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.
>Search for Blynk and install Blynk Library by Volodymyr Shymanskyy.


>>>>>>Download Blynk App from Play Store / App Store.

Create a New Project in Blynk.
Choose ESP8266 as the device and connection type Wi-Fi.
Copy the Auth Token (needed in the code).
