Interfacing DHT11 with Arduino uno 

Step 1: DHT11 (Temperature and Humidity Sensor)


Hardware Required:  
> DHT11 Sensor 
> Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno)
> Jumper wires


Connections:
             VCC to 5V
            GND to GND
            Data Pin to a digital pin (D2) on Arduino

            
Arduino Code:
 code to read the temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor and display them.

Library requirement
//Install the DHT11 Library:
      ............................Open Arduino IDE.   --->>Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries.
                                                              Search for DHT sensor library and install it.
