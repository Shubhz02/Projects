Project Name: Real-Time Health Monitoring System

Project Overview:
This IoT-based Real-Time Health Monitoring System uses an ESP8266 microcontroller to collect and transmit health data, such as temperature,
humidity, and ECG signals, to ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring and analysis. The system also displays health parameters on an LCD 16x2 screen for local monitoring.


Key Features:
✅ Wireless IoT Monitoring – Sends real-time health data to the cloud (ThingSpeak).
✅ Local Display – LCD 16x2 shows live temperature, humidity, and ECG readings.
✅ Multi-Sensor Integration – Uses DHT11 (temperature & humidity) and an ECG sensor.
✅ SPI & UART Communication – Ensures efficient sensor data transfer and debugging.



Hardware Components:
•	ESP8266 – Wi-Fi microcontroller for IoT applications.
•	LCD 16x2 – Displays real-time health data.
•	DHT11 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity.
•	ECG Sensor – Monitors heart rate and ECG signals.
•	IoT (ThingSpeak) – Stores and visualizes health data online.
•	SPI & UART Communication – Used for sensor interfacing and data transmission.


Working Principle:
1️Sensors (DHT11 & ECG) collect real-time health parameters.
2️ ESP8266 processes the sensor data.
3️ The data is displayed on the LCD 16x2 for instant monitoring.
4️ The system sends the data to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi for remote access.


Conclusion:
This project is a low-cost, efficient IoT solution for real-time health monitoring. It can be used in hospitals, home healthcare, 
and remote patient monitoring systems to track vital health parameters and alert doctors or caregivers in case of abnormalities.
